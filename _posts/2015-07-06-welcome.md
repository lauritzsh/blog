An introduction to the face behind this blog.

<!--more-->

Really appreciate that you are visiting my site. I will try to keep it brief so I
don't lose your attention!

## Who am I?
My name is Lauritz Hils√∏e, I'm in my early 20s, and trying to figure out
software development. That's why I am pursuing an undergraduate at the [IT
University of Copenhagen][itu]. Enjoying it so far!

I am at the moment really interested in learning and writing apps for the web. I
spend most of the time writing the backend and the 'backend of the frontend'
(think React, Backbone etc.) i.e. not so much design as functionality.  
In the future I would like to expand and write apps for OS X and iOS as well.

I try to stay active on [GitHub][github] and [Twitter][twitter] as well.

## What is this about?
This is my personal blog. I wasn't planning on sticking to a specific topic but
instead use it for tips, tutorials, interests, projects, and to document new
technologies (mainly for myself so I really have to understand it).

By keeping this blog public and let others read it, I hope some of it can be of
use to you too. Please don't hesitate to ask or tell me to make something more
clear. I appreciate any feedback.

## How to contact me?
Shoot me an [email][email], leave a comment, open an issue, or find me on
[Twitter][twitter].

Thanks for taking the time to read this!
