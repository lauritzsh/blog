# About me
Hi, I'm Lauritz HilsÃ¸e from Denmark. I'm trying to become a developer, so I
study software development at the [IT University of
Copenhagen](http://www.itu.dk/en/). I like it so far.

My primary interest (at the moment) is web development. Front and back-end.
Our web browsers are getting more powerful and the possibilities are growing for
what's possible with the web. New technologies are being adopted quickly. It's
quite exciting I think.

I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lauritzsh) (mostly) retweeting funny
stuff. ðŸŒš

## ...but why this blog?
I've wanted a blog for some time actually. Problem was: _what the heck should I
write about?_ Being 20 it's not like I have infinite wisdom.

I like to read and learn about new tools, technologies, and frameworks. I'll
document my findings here in a post so it can be shared with others. It's a
great way for me to learn and might even be of use for someone else. It's about
my [journey from novice to
expert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition).  
My focus (for the time being) will be spend on web development and related
tools.

It would be awesome if any of my writing was of use to you. I appreciate you
taking the time to read about me and my blog. I'd love to hear your questions or
feedback (even if it's to correct me) so I you encourage to comment. Thank you.

## Can I contact you?
Always welcome to shoot me an email at
[mail@lauritz.me](mailto:mail@lauritz.me).

## I'm offended/you're wrong/that's not true etc.
If you want something corrected for whatever reason then it might be easiest to
write me an [email](mailto:mail@lauritz.me) or open an
[issue](https://github.com/lauritzsh/blog/issues). I'll look it over and
probably change it if I feel it's a valid. A pull request would be cool.
